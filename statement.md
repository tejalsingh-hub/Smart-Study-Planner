# Smart Study Planner – Statement of the Project

## 📌 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to manage multiple tasks, assignments, and exams with different deadlines and priorities.  
Manual planning can lead to poor time allocation, last-minute rush, and increased stress.  
There is a need for a tool that can automatically generate well-balanced study plans by analyzing task complexity, deadlines, and the student’s available study hours.

The Smart Study Planner solves this problem by providing an automated and optimized scheduling system that distributes workload intelligently.
